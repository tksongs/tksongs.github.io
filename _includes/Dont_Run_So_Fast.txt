VERSE 1:

         E                     B
You can walk, but please don't run.
       C#m                  C#m  B  A
It's hard to do when you're having  fun.
               E               B
But there's a reason we don't race;
            C#m                            C#m  B   A
When you're with the friends, it's not the time or place.


CHORUS:

       E   B    A
Don't run  so  fast.
          E         B           A
Take your time and make things last.
          E         B        A      G
Learn to love the things you do.
                E     A     E     A    
Just don't run fast.

        
VERSE 2: 

You got things you have to do.
People to serve, who depend on you.
But don't forget why you're here.
Learn to love the friends; let them know you care.

[CHORUS]


VERSE 3: 

You can run to someone's door.
Is there someone home? Well, you're not real sure.
But look around and see everyone.
People walking by, can you talk to one?

[CHORUS]


Oh. just don't run fast!
